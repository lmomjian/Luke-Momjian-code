This repository contains 4 files for the NeuroFlow Data Analyst: Data Challenge.

Part 1 contains one Excel file with graphs, and one Word doc with discussion.
Since I have recently started learning Python and do not yet have proficiency in a programming language to generate the desired visualzations, I worked in MS Office to produce the necessary results. 

Part 2 contains two Git files with SQL code.
