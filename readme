This repository contains 4 files for the NeuroFlow Data Analyst: Data Challenge.

Part 1 contains one Excel file with graphs, and one Word doc with discussion.
Since I have only recently started learning Python, I worked in MS Office to produce the necessary results.
Were I selected for this position, I would look forward to developing my Python skills and becoming proficient in the language.

Part 2 contains two Git files with SQL code.
